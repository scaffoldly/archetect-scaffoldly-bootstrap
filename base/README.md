# scaffoldly-bootstrap

This is the Terraform configuration for this organization.

This repository automatically generated by
[Scaffoldly](https://start.scaffold.ly).

## Running Locally

It is not currently possible to test any changes locally, however, changes will
automatically generate a `terraform plan` on a push to `main`.

## Deployments / Versioning

### Planning Changes

Upon a push to `main`, GitHub Actions will automatically trigger a
`terraform plan` operation so the required changes can be previewed. The plan
output can be reviewed in a newly created release.

### Applying Changes

Changes can be applied by publishing a release that was created after the `plan`
operation. Navigate to the [most recent release](./releases), click 'Edit'
then 'Publish Release'.
